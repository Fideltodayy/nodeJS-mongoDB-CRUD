I began setting up my project and installed dependancies that I was to us in my project.
I then set up my MongoDB database and built a model using my mongoose ORM. I was to install mongoDB but chose to install mongoose as my ORM, an easier way to create schemas.

## Dependencies

1. Express
2. Mongoose
3. Mocha
4. Chai
5. chai-http
